This is a map application of all the pit stop locations for the (cancelled) 2020 Bike to Work Day. Clicking on a pit stop location reveals a popup with the name of the pit stop and a button with a link to the Bike to Work Day signup form prefilled with that pit stop's information. Our motive for building the application was to make it more intuitive for participants to signup for the pit stop closest to their route.

The application architecture is very simple, built using Mapbox GL JS to display a basemap and data in Mapbox Studio.
